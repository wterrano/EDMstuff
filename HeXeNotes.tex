\section{First look (Oct 25, 2015) at SQUID data taken on Oct 5, 2015 while powering on the lab}
Some useful channels:
\begin{itemize}
\item Squid channel {\bf y1} was connected to a large, {\bf z} oriented pick-up coil.  Thus it measured the same magnetic field direction as {\bf z1} and {\bf z2} but with different sensitivity.
\item Squid channel {\bf x2} was not in FLL mode, making it a test of other noise in the electronics chain.
\item Tobias used Helmholtz coils to find a relative calibration of 5.552  between the pick-up coil and \textbf{z} channels. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Squid da1a with the rest of the electronics in the lab turned off}

Data contained in file : \texttt{"2015-10-05 13-45-38.031713.dig"}.  Taken together they suggest that the 
\begin{itemize}
\item Pickup coil shows $\sim$ 5 times more spread in voltage vs. time as the normal squid coils, in agreement with Tobi's calibration.
\item Disconnected channel shows $\sim$ 12 times less voltage spread.
\end{itemize}

Taken together (and shown in \ref{fig: All Off} this data set suggests that, with everything in the room turned off, the squid channels are seeing real magnetic field noise.
